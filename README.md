# kata-Yatzy-solution

A solution for Kata Yatzy, original starter code is from here:
https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata

Currently I provided the groovy version.  I found the Yatzy kata is a good Kata to learn functional programming, but that would be rewriting instead of refactoring.
